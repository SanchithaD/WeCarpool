# WeCarpool
## Inspiration
We knew that global warming and air pollution were big problems in the world, and we were eager to solve these problems with an app. Everyone wants to help with the issue–– but most don't know how. Our app allows everyone to help out by carpooling more often, which can positively impact the amount of emissions on the road.

## What it does
Our app is a safe platform where the user can collaborate with their contacts and set up rides to specified destinations. Just choose your destination,

## What's next for WeCarpool
We're planning on making the app safer and having a functional database which actually stores the login info. We also would like to add a sign-up feature and an 'edit profile' button which allows the user to enter information about themselves for their contacts to see.
